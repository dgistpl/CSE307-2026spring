# Problem 2: `range : int -> int -> int list`

**Homework 1 - CSE307, Spring 2026**

## Description

Write a function

```
range : int -> int -> int list
```

that takes two integers `n` and `m`, and creates a list of integers from `n` to `m`. When `n > m`, an empty list is returned.

## Examples

```ocaml
range 3 7 = [3; 4; 5; 6; 7]
range 5 4 = []
```
